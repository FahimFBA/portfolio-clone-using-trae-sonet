# Portfolio Clone (Static HTML/CSS Version)

This project is a static HTML/CSS replication of my personal portfolio website [fahimbinamin.com](https://fahimbinamin.com), which was originally built using Next.js. The goal was to recreate the look and feel of the Next.js version using only HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and minimal JavaScript for effects and interactivity.

## Features
- Responsive design using Bootstrap 5
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Animated sections using AOS (Animate On Scroll)
- Font Awesome icons for social links
- Loading animation on page load
- Sections: Home, About, Experience, Teaching, Writing, Contact

## How This Was Replicated
- The original Next.js project structure and components were analyzed.
- All dynamic and React-specific features were replaced with static HTML and Bootstrap equivalents.
- CSS was adapted and extended to match the original design as closely as possible.
- JavaScript libraries (AOS, Bootstrap JS) were included via CDN for animations and navigation.
- Theme toggling and advanced interactivity from the Next.js version were omitted for simplicity.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FahimFBA/portfolio-clone-using-trae-sonet.git
   ```
2. Open index.html in your browser.
   - No build step or server is required; everything runs client-side.
